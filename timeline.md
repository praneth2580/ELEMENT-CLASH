ðŸ“œ Tactical Card Game Upgrade Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation Systems (Core Battle Loop)
 Refine Status Effects System

 Standardize effects: Burn, Freeze, Shock, Root, Weaken, Boost

 Effects should have duration (e.g., 2 turns)

 Effects can stack or overwrite (define rules)

 Add Affinity Strength/Weakness System

 Water > Fire (+50% damage)

 Fire > Air (+50% damage)

 Air > Earth (+50% damage)

 Earth > Water (+50% damage)

 Penalty on wrong matchup (e.g., -10% attack)

 Complete Energy / Aura Resource System

 Base Aura per turn (e.g., gain +1 Aura per turn)

 Aura cost to attempt Synergy

 Certain cards can give Aura boosts or cost more

Phase 2: Tactical Layer Systems (Hand and Play Control)
 Implement Hand Management Mechanics

 Allow player to discard a card

 On discard, pay a cost (e.g., lose 10 HP) to draw a new card

 Limit discards per turn (e.g., max 1-2)

 Add Battlefield Conditions (Dynamic Environment Effects)

 Randomly roll battlefield condition each match start

 Possible battlefield effects:

Heavy Rain: Water cards +20% damage

Scorching Heat: Fire cards cost -1 Aura

Earthquake: Earth cards crit chance up

Storm Winds: Air cards 30% dodge boost

 Battlefield lasts whole match or rotates every X turns

Phase 3: Advanced Strategic Systems (Deck and Hero Building)
 Implement Dynamic Deck Modifiers (Mini Deckbuilding)

 After each battle, allow:

Add 1 new random card to deck

Remove 1 card (at a cost maybe?)

Upgrade 1 card (make slightly stronger / cheaper)

 Keep deck size limits (e.g., 20-30 cards)

 Create Card Traits & Personalities

 Add random traits to cards:

"Volatile" (explodes if discarded)

"Loyal" (bonus if played after matching element)

"Greedy" (costs 1 extra Aura but double damage if successful)

 Traits appear visually on cards

 Add Hero Abilities / Classes

 Define 3-5 hero classes

 Each class has:

1 Passive ability

1 Active ability (optional)

 Examples:

Flame Knight: Fire synergy costs no Aura once per match

Tidecaller: Water heal 10% after every synergy

Sky Thief: Chance to steal Aura from enemy

ðŸŽ¯ Final Polish (Once Core Systems Done)
 Add Combo Chains / Momentum System (Optional)

 Add Interrupt Cards (Advanced)

 Add Rare Dual-Element Cards

 Add Card Evolution (Level up cards mid-run)

ðŸš€ Notes
Work in vertical slices â†’ Finish one system at a time (even simple version first).

Test battles after every Phase to adjust balance.

Keep adding small UI feedbacks (particles, sounds) when new systems trigger!
